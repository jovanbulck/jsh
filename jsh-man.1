.SH BUGS REPORTS
If you find a bug or vulnerability in \fBjsh\fP, you should report it on the github page (https://github.com/jovanbulck/jo-shell/issues). Please include the output of \fBjsh --version\fP in all bug reports.
.SH KNOWN BUGS
\fBjsh\fP only supports a small subset of the \fBsh\fP language grammar and its interpretation can sometimes be ambiguous. You're welcome to propose better interpretations on the github page, linked above.

Single quotes (') and backticks (`) are not (yet) interpreted by the \fBjsh\fP shell.

Environment variables are not yet implemented. This will be added in future releases.

Job control is not yet implemented; pressing ^Z will suspend the \fBjsh\fP shell. Background jobs will be implemented in future releases.
.SH DISCLAIMER
\fBjsh\fP is not a master thesis.

\fBjsh\fP can be time-consuming and school-distracting. 

Any resemblance of \fBjsh\fP to actual persons is purely coincidental.
